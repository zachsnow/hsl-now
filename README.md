# hsl-now

A simple HSL "clock". I saw an RGB one that didn't transition very smoothly through
different colors (as that wasn't the point), so I thought "how might I make one that does".
I'm sure it's been done every which way from Sunday, but that's ok.

Just for fun.

## Demo

(If you can call it that).
